# Matrix Analysis, spring semester 2023

This repository contains the notebooks for the exercises sessions of the course Matrix Theory

The course will address the following topics:
- Linear transformations
- Pseudo-inverse
- Projections and norms
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors and eigenvalue problems
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Linear Equations
- Random matrices
- Linear Least Squares
- Linear differential and difference equations



Every time you want to work, do the following:

1. Open a terminal. Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
1. Activate the environment with `conda activate matrix-theory-2023`.
1. Navigate to the folder where you stored the course material with `cd path/to/folder/matrix-theory-2023`.
1. Start Jupyter with `jupyter lab`. The command should open a new tab in your web browser.
1. Edit and run the notebooks from your browser.
1. Once done, you can run `conda deactivate` to leave the `matrix-theory-2023` environment.
